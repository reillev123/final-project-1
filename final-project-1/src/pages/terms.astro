        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to BakeMyDay, where every visit is a treat and every recipe is a piece of cake! By using our website, you agree to mix in a bit of fun with these terms and conditions. So, let's get rolling!
            
            1. Acceptance of Terms
            By accessing or using BakeMyDay, you agree to be whisked away by these terms and conditions, our privacy policy, and any additional guidelines or rules posted on the site. If you don't agree, it's time to knead your way out of here.
            
            2. Use of the Website
            Our website is an oven-fresh space for you to discover, share, and enjoy baking recipes. Please use it responsibly:
            
            </p>

            <p>
            Don’t use our content for any half-baked schemes or doughy dealings.
            Respect our bakers and their recipes; don't pinch or republish content without giving proper credit.
            Keep the community sweet by refraining from any burnt or crumbly behavior, such as harassment or posting offensive content.
            3. User Accounts
            To fully enjoy our recipe collection, you might want to create an account:
            
            Keep your username and password in a safe place, like you would your secret ingredient.
            Don’t let others mess with your account; you’re responsible for all activities that happen under your baking hat.
            We reserve the right to sift through accounts and terminate those that violate these terms.
            4. Content Submission
            Got a recipe that's the icing on the cake? Share it with us! By submitting content, you:
            
            Grant BakeMyDay a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute your content.
            Ensure that your recipe is an original creation and doesn’t include any stolen sprinkles or borrowed batter.
            5. Intellectual Property
            All the ingredients of our website, including text, graphics, logos, and images, are the bread and butter of BakeMyDay and our licensors:

            You’re welcome to use our recipes for personal, non-commercial use.
            Don’t slice and dice our content for commercial purposes without our express written permission.
            6. Limitation of Liability
            BakeMyDay is here to make your baking experience a delight, but:
            
            We can’t guarantee that every recipe will rise to the occasion or that our site will always be available.
            We’re not responsible for any kitchen mishaps, burnt cookies, or failed soufflés resulting from following our recipes.
            7. Changes to Terms
            Just like any good recipe, our terms may need a little tweaking now and then:
            
            We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We’ll do our best to sprinkle some notice your way, but it’s your responsibility to stay updated.
            Continued use of BakeMyDay after changes means you’re still on board with our baking plan.
            8. Governing Law
            These terms are governed by the flour and sugar of the land where BakeMyDay is based. Any disputes will be handled in the courts of our kitchen headquarters.
